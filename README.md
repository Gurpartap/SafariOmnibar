What is this?
=============

Safari Omnibar is a Safari SIMBL plugin aiming at mimicing the Chrome's smart location bar which combines location and search.

Requirement
===========

- Safari 5.1 (Lion)
- [SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) 1.9.9 (packaged with the installer)

Installation
============

Download our [installer](https://github.com/downloads/rs/SafariOmnibar/Safari%20Omnibar.pkg) and run it then restart Safari.

Uninstall
=========

Remove the file `/Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins/SafariOmnibar.bundle`

Usage
=====

Just type our search in the location bar and it will perform a Google search.

TODO
====

- Preference Panel
- Let the user choose not to hide the Safari's search field
- Search engine editor with keyword support just like Chrome's
- Google auto-suggests injection in the completion menu
